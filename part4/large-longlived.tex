\chapter{Scalability of Long-lived Data}
\label{chapter:large-long-lived}

Objects that live forever have it easy! They are free from the bugs that riddle
objects with correlated lifetime. How can an object that is \emph{supposed}
to live forever be part of a memory leak? A challenge that many developers face
is the case where objects that are needed forever do not fit into the
limits of available Java heap, or available memory.

\begin{example}{Nodes and Edges}
Consider representing a graph, one with a great many nodes and edges.

\section{The Bulk Sharing Pool}
\label{sec:bulk-sharing-pool}

The bulk storage that backs a set of data items, each of the same type. Objects
share the data by indexing into the pool.
