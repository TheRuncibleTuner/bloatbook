%Bugs, performance problems, memory footprint.




%Story
%-------
%data has a natural lifetime
	%you can use the above mechanisms to manage
%sometimes we extend lifetime to optimize (for time)
%sometimes we shorten lifetime to optimize (for space)


%Problems:
	%Temps -- saving time
	%Making things fit
		%Things you need
		%Things you can recompute

		
		
		
%Chapter 1: Natural Lifetimes
	%- if scopes don't coincide with lifetime
	%- actual lifetime may be different from natural lifetime, for performance reasons
%Chapter 2: Getting Lifetime Correct
%Chapter 3: Getting It Small and Fast
