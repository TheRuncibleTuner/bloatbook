\chapter{Implementing Lifetime Requirements}

Designing a lifetime management strategy
requires that you take the tools that Java provides, and combine them
with other strategies implemented on top of Java. The built-in mechanisms,
nominally, handle some of the common patterns of object lifetime.
Unfortunately, they often appear in the form of low-level JVM hooks, and so
require careful coding to make correct use of them.  


A \code{static} field of an object is one way that Java gives you to indicate
that you want an object to live forever.
