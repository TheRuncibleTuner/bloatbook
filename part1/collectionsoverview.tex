\chapter{Collections: An Introduction}
\label{chapter:brief-introduction-collections}

Collections are the glue that bind your data together.  Whether 
providing random or sequential access, or enabling
look up by value, collections are an essential part of any
design. In Java, collections are easy to use, and, just as easily, to misuse when
it comes to space. Like much else in Java, they don't come with a price tag
showing how much memory they need. In fact, collections
often use much more memory than you might expect. In most Java applications they are the second largest consumer of memory, after
Strings. It's not unusual for collection overhead to take up between x and y\%
of the Java heap. The way collections are employed can make
or break a system's ability to scale up.

%awareness of costs; thorough analysis of scalability; whether or not will scale

This chapter and the next four chapters are about using
collections in a space-efficient way.  Collections may serve a number of very
different purposes in an application. They can be used to implement
relationships, to organize data into tables, to enable quick lookup via indexes, or
to store annotations with more formally modeled data. Each use
has its own best practices as well as traps. The current chapter
is a short introduction to common issues that are important to understand in
any use of collections. The following four chapters are an in-depth guide to 
the different ways collections are used. Each of these chapters takes
you through typical patterns of usage, shows what collections cost for those
patterns, and gives you techniques for analyzing how local implementation
decisions will play out at a larger scale. Here is a roadmap of the next four chapters:

%Clarifying requirements can lead to specialized solutions
%can suggest space-saving solutions, so that you are not paying for
%functionality you don't need.
%Look inside a few important collection classes
%

\begin{description}
\item[Chapter~\ref{chapter:representing-relationships}. Representing
Relationships] An important use of collections is to implement
relationships that let you quickly navigate from an object to related objects
via references. This chapter covers the typical patterns and pitfalls of
implementing relationships. At runtime, each relationship becomes a
large number of collection instances, with many containing just a few elements
each.
%In a product catalog, for example, each product object would have one
%collection instance pointing to that product's suppliers, and another pointing
%to the product's parts.
The main issues to watch for in these designs
are keeping the cost of small and empty collections to a minimum, sizing
collections properly, and paying only for functionality that is truly needed.

\item[Chapter~\ref{chapter:tables-indexes}. Tables and Indexes] This
chapter covers collections that serve as the jumping off point for accessing
objects. This could be a table that provides direct access to all the
objects of one type, or an index for looking up objects by unique key. These are
usually large structures. In more complex cases, such as multikey and multivalue
maps, there is a choice between a single collection vs. a
multilevel structure. This chapter covers predicting memory costs as the structure
grows.
%understanding which costs are amortized and which are not 

\item[Chapter~\ref{chapter:dynamic-records}. Attribute Maps and Dynamic
Records] Many applications need to represent data whose shape is not
known at compile time. Two examples are property-value pairs
read from a configuration file at runtime, and database records returned from
a dynamic query. Since Java does not let you define new classes on the
fly, collections are a natural, though very inefficient way to represent
these dynamic records. This chapter looks at the common cases where dynamic records
are needed, and shows how to identify properties of your data that could lead to
more space-efficient solutions.

\item[Chapter~\ref{chapter:additional-collection-behaviors}. Additional
Collection Behaviors] Collections sometimes need to supply functionality
beyond their main purpose of storing and accessing data. For example,
you may want to protect a table from inadvertent
updates, or minimize contention on a map when running in a
multithreaded environment. Java collections provide these capabilities through
specialized classes or through wrappers that alter
the function of existing collection classes. This chapter covers the costs of
this functionality. A key issue is that the depth
at which these features are used can have a big impact on the memory
cost.

\end{description}

Across all of these different cases, collections have some common themes.
The rest of this chapter is an overview of issues and resources to be aware of
in any use of collections. First is a brief
introduction to the memory costs of collections. It is followed by a
survey of collections resources available in the
standard libraries and some open source alternatives.

\section{The Cost of Collections}
%\section{Designing with Collections}
\label{sec:designing-with-collections}

Like other building blocks in Java, the memory costs
of the standard collections are high overall. 
The very smallest collection, an \emph{empty}
\class{ArrayList}, takes up 40 bytes, and that's only when it's been carefully
initialized. By default it takes 80 bytes. That may not sound like a lot by
itself, but when deeply nested in a design, that cost could easily be multiplied
by a few hundred thousand instances.  



%In addition, the standard APIs can force you into expensive
%decisions in other parts of your design, such as requiring you to box scalars
%that you place in collections. 
%In this and
%the next four chapters we show you how to figure out those costs, and how
%to avoid some common traps. Armed with this
%knowledge you can choose carefully, ensuring that you are not
%overpaying for your system's needs.

%Even with high costs in general, there are some things that you do
%have some choice over, such as which collection classes to use, and how they
%are initialized.

%and how your data is
%structured to use them effectively. (move to scalability section?)


Fortunately there are some choices you can make that
can save a lot of space. The cost of different
collection classes can vary greatly, even among ones that might work equally well in the same situation. For example,
a 5-element \class{ArrayList} with room for growth takes 80 bytes. An equivalent \class{HashSet} costs 276 bytes,
or 3.5 times as much. Like other kinds of infrastructure, collections serve a
necessary function, and paying for overhead can be worthwhile. That is, as long as you are not
paying for features you don't need. In the above example, a
70\% space savings can be achieved if the application can do without the
uniqueness checking provided by \class{HashSet}.  In Section~\ref{sec:better-designs} we saw another example
of a large improvement by identifying functionality that wasn't needed, in that
case the real-time maintenance of sort order. In the next chapters we'll see
more examples of how looking carefully at the functionality your system needs from collections can help reduce space.

There is also much that is not under your control in the cost of
collections.
%making it all the more important to become familiar with what
%collections cost. 
The collection libraries are written in Java, and they suffer
from the same kinds of bloat we've encountered in other kinds of data. They have internal layers of delegation,
and extra fields for features that your program may not use. The standard
collections do have a few options that can help, such as giving you some control over 
excess capacity for growth. On the whole, though, they do not provide many
levers for tuning to individual situations. They were mostly designed for speed rather than space, and
they appear to have been designed for applications with  
few large and growing collections. Yet many systems also have large numbers
of small collections that never grow once initialized. Given all of this, it is important
to be aware of what collections cost, so you can make informed choices as early as possible. 

It is not enough to know the cost of collections in the abstract, but to
understand \emph{how they will work in your design}. This is because the same
collection class will have very different scaling behavior in different
situations. For example, a particular map class may be perfect as a single index
over a large table, but may be prohibitively expensive
when there are many instances of it nested inside a multilevel,
multikey index. Collections have \emph{fixed} and \emph{variable} costs, as we saw
in Section~\ref{sec:scalability}. The fixed cost is the base memory
the collection needs, with or without any elements.
The variable cost is the space it needs to store each
element. The way these costs add up
depends on the context in which the collection appears
for example, whether
there are many small collections, a few large ones, or some
combination. High fixed costs only matter when
there are a lot of collection \emph{instances}. High variable costs matter when
there are a lot of \emph{elements}, regardless of whether the elements are
spread across a lot of small collections
or concentrated in a few large ones.
%Some collection costs will be amortized as
%more data is stored, others will only continue to grow. 
Table~\ref{tab:collections-fixed-and-variable} shows the fixed and variable
costs for some commonly used collections.  %default constructor
Collections with high fixed costs should be used only as large collections, so
the fixed cost will be amortized. 
%Certain collections are designed
%to be used at a certain scale --- when there are a few large collections, not a
%lot of smaller ones.  
Collection costs also need to be
considered together with the data they are storing. If a data structure uses expensive collections to store small amounts of data, than it
will have a high overhead ratio, and ultimately the application's ability to
support a large amount of data will be limited. Knowing how to analyze these costs
in the context of your design is the key to ensuring that your system will scale when it is time for deployment. That analysis will help you choose the right collection for your
design, or if you need to restructure your data into a more efficient design.

%That is the focus of the next four chapters.

costs, and where appropriate to use. 

\section{The Standard Java Collections}

.. We take a look inside a few of the collections along they way in the next
four chapters. 

The Java Collections framework comes with some lesser-known collections that
provide useful functionality.  In some cases, this functionality comes at a 
a lower space cost than the more general-purpose equivalent.  In other cases,
the cost is higher. Table~\ref{tab:} gives more detail about these collections.

\begin{description}
\item[Static collection classes] Singleton, empty, etc. Arrays.
\item[Specialized maps] Identity HashMap; EnumMap.
\item[Wrapped collections?]
\item[ConcurrentHashMap?]
\item[Java 1 Collections] Hashtable, Vector.
\item[EnumSet?]
\end{description}


\section{Alternative Collections Frameworks}
In addition to the standard Java collections classes, there are a number of
open source collections frameworks available. Many of these frameworks
are designed to give you additional functionality or make it easier to
program. With some exceptions, most are not designed to be efficient from a
space standpoint. While some do make much better use of space, and give you a
better ability to customize for your situation, others actually have a
large footprint for the same functionality as the standard libraries. So as in
anything else, being an informed consumer (by measuring) is the best way to
avoid problems later. Below is a short summary of the most
popular alternative collections frameworks.

Important note: there are many kinds of open source licenses. Each has different
restrictions on usage. Make sure to check with your organization's open
source software policies to see if you may use a specific framework in 
your product, service or internal system.

\section{Summary}
Using collections carefully can
make the difference between a design that scales well and one that
doesn't. Some items to be aware of when working with collections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The standard Java collections, along with most alternative
  collections, were designed more for speed than for space. They are
  not optimized for some common cases, such as designs with many small
  collections. In general the Java collections use a lot of memory.
 %not designed for the ways they are actually used.
  \item Collections vary widely in their memory usage. Awareness of
  costs is an essential first step in choosing well. Sometimes there is a less
  expensive choice of collection class available. Initialization options
  can also make a big difference.
  \item The same collection class will scale differently depending on its
  context. Ensuring scalability means
  analyzing how a collection's fixed and variable costs
  play out in a given situation. Watch out for: collections with
  high fixed costs when you have a lot of small collections, and 
  collections with high variable costs when you have a
  lot of elements.
  \item Analyzing your application's requirements, such as 
  which features of a collection are really needed, can suggest
  less expensive choices.
\end{itemize}
