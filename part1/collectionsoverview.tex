\chapter{A Brief Overview of Collections}
Collections are the glue that connect your data together. In
many Java heaps, they are the second largest consumer of memory, after Strings. 
It is common for heaps to have x-y\% of the space consumed by collections.  By the way, when we talk about
collections we use the term broadly to mean random and sequential
access structures, such as lists, sets, and arrays, as well as associative
structures such as maps and property-value pairs.

While collections serve an important functional purpose, it's an
adminstrative one, and so we may think of them as pure overhead.
Overhead can be worthwhile, as long as the cost is reasonable
for the benefit attained. Like much else in Java, collections are easy to take ``off the shelf'' and use, but
their costs are not obvious. Because the collections themselves are
implemented in Java, their implementations suffer from the same kinds of bloat
as other Java structures, such as delegation
overhead and overgenerality. One goal of the next few chapters is to help you
become aware of these costs, so that you are not paying for
functionality that you don't need.

The memory costs of collections vary widely in Java, sometimes by one or
two orders of magnitude for different options that could work just as well in
the same design.  %Give a numeric example here instead
The good news is that a few small programming
changes or configuration settings can often have a big impact. At the same
time, there is much that is not under your control. The next few
chapters will also help you evaluate your overall design for scalability, early
enough when design changes are still possible.

Collections are used for many purposes in Java applications. In the
next four chapters we walk you through the common ways collections are used,
pointing out traps and some space-saving best practices. First, in this
chapter, we take a quick tour of the issues you are likely to face when
using collections, and give you some basic guidelines. We also give you a guide to
some available collection resources.

to let you navigate from an object to its related objects, using references.
