\chapter{Tables and Indexes}
\label{chapter:tables-indexes}

This chapter is about larger structures that are jumping off points for
accessing large numbers of objects. Collections and associated data used to
implement structures such as tables, indexes, and work queues can take up a lot
of memory if care is not taken. The first section looks at random and sequential access.  The rest of the
chapter is devoted to maps.  

Special cases can be implemented more optimally.
