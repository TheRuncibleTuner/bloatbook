\chapter{Preface}

Over the past ten years, we have worked with developers, testers, and performance analysts to help fix memory-related problems in large Java applications.
During the many years we have spent studying the performance of Java applications, it has become clear to us that the problems related to memory is a topic worthy of a book.

The book is appropriate for Java developers (experienced and novice alike), especially framework and applications developers, who are faced with decisions every day that will have impact down the line in system test and production. It is also aimed at technical managers and testers, who need to make sure that Java software meets its performance requirements.  This material should be of interest to students and teachers of software engineering, who would like to gain a better understanding of memory usage patterns in real-world Java applications. Basic knowledge of Java is assumed.
